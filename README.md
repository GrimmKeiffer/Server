# Server Build

## Objective
This project involved assembling and equipping a server rack to facilitate the relocation of critical IT infrastructure to our local office. The rack was carefully designed and outfitted to ensure efficient power distribution, network management, and system reliability.

### Items Installed (Ongoing)
- Power Distribution Unit (PDU): Mounted at the top for centralized power management.
- Patch Panel: Positioned below the PDU for streamlined cable organization and easy network connections.
- Network Switch: Installed beneath the patch panel to manage internal networking and data traffic.
- Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS): Placed at the bottom to provide backup power and protect against outages.
- Additional Battery System: Installed above the primary UPS to extend backup runtime and ensure uninterrupted operations.

## Steps
Phase 1: Rack Assembly
- Unpack and inspect all rack components.
- Assemble the frame, ensuring structural stability.
- Secure the rack in its designated location, considering airflow and accessibility.
- Verify leveling and adjust feet or casters as needed.

Phase 2: Power Setup
- Mount the Power Distribution Unit (PDU) at the top of the rack.
- Route power cables efficiently to avoid clutter.

Phase 3: Network Infrastructure
- Install the Patch Panel below the PDU for structured cable management.
- Mount the Network Switch beneath the patch panel.
- Connect and organize network cables, securing them with cable ties or management arms.

Phase 4: Power Backup System
- Place the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) at the bottom of the rack.
- Install the Additional Battery System above the primary UPS to extend backup capacity.
- Connect and test power redundancy to ensure seamless failover.
